 .IX Header "Pipe and Each"
 You can pipe the output of one \f(CW\*(C`git hub\*(C'\fR into another and multiply your power. The command being piped into should use the \s-1EACH\s0 option which is a single dash ('\-'). It will cause the command to be run once for each line of input, inserting the line into the command, in place of the '\-'. If you use a '=' it will do the same thing except for each \*(L"word\*(R" of input.
